 Computers only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns to execute the commands we provide.
 Compiler is a special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language(Human understandable  language) and turns them into machine language 
 When ever we give a executable file to compiler using lexical analysis it convert the given code in to tokens then the tokens are arranged in parse tree then it follows few intermediate steps
 like optimization, assembly code, object code, linking and it makes a machine code that give correct pattern for compiler to execute correct commands and stores in the memory 
 Example: Int x = 3;
 after parsing it store the value of x in memory location if we change the code again it compiler follows all the process and store the value in the updated location other then storing
 compiler performs a lot of other task based on the instructions provided in the code.
 if we write compile code on one machine may not work on another machine new computer might have different operating system or hardware configurations so we have to create 
 executable file for each and operating system to make it work
